README for the KAC ZWANZIG sim

For this to compile, you need the gnu scientific library and openmp installed

please use the makefile:    >> make clean 
                            >> make
                            >> ./Badsym   

ideally, you should only change data in global.h. A short list of the parameters you can change are:

OSSZI: bath size, please use multiples of ten
SIMULATIONEN: number of runs for averaging
KUPF_BINARY: set to 1 for fully mobile bath, 0 for Zwanzig's original   
model, when in doubt leave 1
DIM : change dimension of the problem, currently only 1 or 2 supported
TIME_STEPS: stepsize at which to record data
TIME_END: number of such steps. NEEDS!! format (I + 9)
THREADNR: number threads
TEMP: Temperature in Kelvin
GAMMA: constant before bath coupling constants, K_0 in masterh thesis
ALPHA: desired scaling of the MSD ~t^ALPHA
mass: mass distinguished particle
TIME_ARRIVAL : geometries are specified in terms of time for diffusion over lattice cell, i.e. if one cell should be diffused over in 1000s set TIMEA_ARRIVAL to 1000.0
MAXSTEPSIZEMULT: integrator stepsize is ballstic time scale time this, at least .1 recommended
LABEL: "ZWANZIG" for P_0=0, "ZWANZIG_THERMALIZED" for equilibrated start
STEPPER METHOD: sets target. Pick from 'VVerlet_Step_deriv_Box' (1-D box), 'VVerlet_Step_deriv_Kupf' for free diffusion or 
'VVerlet_Step_hardsphere_reflect_Kupf' for square lattice of spheres
MAX_NR_PLOTS: Number of example trajectorier in you trajec folder of the simulation

Now, at the end of the run you get a list of files into your results folder

These files are:

ekin.dat : paris of time and kinetic energy of distinguished particle
ekinbath.dat : same for total bath kinetic energy
ETOT: times and total bath energy
global.h: copy of used global.h
latlngth.dat: lattice size used
ommega.dat: list of frequencies of bath
P_X.dat : times and total X-Momentum
squares_rohdaten.dat: times and MSD

the folder trajec also contains a number of sample trajectories (number specified in global.h)

in 1-D in the format t-x, else in x-y
the plot folder is just for convenience for eventual pictures.


Some rough notes on how to modify this:

If you just want to specify another geometry within square lattices, write your own method in target.c and set TARGET_METHOD to your version.

If you want a completely new geometry, you will have to write a neq Steppmethod
